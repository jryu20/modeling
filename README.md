# Predator-Prey Model: Understanding Lotka-Volterra-based Model

In this project, we explore a predator-prey relationship between ducks (predator), fish (prey), and a common food source (namely, an aquatic plant). In doing so, we split the model into 2 different phases: the first phase is with a constant population of the shared food source and the second is without. We then plot the phase portraits and perform a time-series analysis of all possible scenarios arising from the model.
